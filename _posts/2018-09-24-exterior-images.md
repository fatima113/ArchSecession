The inscriprion here translates to _"To each age its art, to art its freedom"_. This goes along with the idea that this 
building was meant to house revolutionary art that was representative of the modern world. It also supports their belief that
art should be something unbounded that should not have to bend to tradition.

This small detail is reminiscent of Greek art. It is simple, yet meticulous. The images of nature connect with the 
anti-academic, modern views of the Secessionist movement.
