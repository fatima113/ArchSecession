## Entrance Hall
![entrance](http://mdxdv.artstor.org/thumb/imgstor/size2/ucsd/d2694/41822003318332.jpg)

The stained glass window allows for natural light to flow in, bathed in color from the glass. This mixture of art with
nature is exactly what the Secessionists emphasized with their non-traditionalist movement.  
The openness of the entrance hall as well as the plantlife surrounding it are inviting. Because the Secessionists hoped 
everyone in their culture would come around to their point of view, it was important for them to be welcoming to all.  
This also pulls you down the hallway and through the doors, into the exhibition area where the art is observed.
