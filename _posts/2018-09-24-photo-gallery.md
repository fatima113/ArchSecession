* ![front-side view](https://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/olbrich/front.jpg)
> Here, the contrast between the white and gold is extremely evident. Also, the way the sun catches the gold.
* ![front entrance](https://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/olbrich/entrancedet.jpg)
> Three medusa heads looking down on you as you enter. Sort of an organized chaos.
* ![pot](https://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/olbrich/entranceangle.jpg)
> Turtles are holding up the pot. Reminds me of old Hindu proverb that the world rests on a turtle's back. Shows strong connection with nature.
* ![side detail](https://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/olbrich/detside.jpg)
> Like vines crawling up an old building. Again, imitating nature. Also drawing eyes up toward the dome.
* ![side detail gold](https://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/olbrich/sideentrancedet.jpg)
> Very similar to detail in previous picture, except gold. Only found around entrance, for maximum effect when entering.
