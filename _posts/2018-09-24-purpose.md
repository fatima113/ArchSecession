This building was created by young, innovative artists as a way of rejecting the traditionalist views of art in their culture. 
It was created by artists for artists. It symbolized a movement from conservative art towards a more expirimental and free type of art
that was akin to life. 

The building was used by artists to host exhibitions that were considered progressive by the era's standards. The artists involved 
were hoping that they could slowly win over the public with their ideas on art.
