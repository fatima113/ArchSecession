The Secession Building is found in a very urban area. Around it there are many bigger buildings that sort of dwarf this one. 
However, it still stands out because it is on its own little wedge of land. 
Additionally, the buildings surrounding it are mostly art and municipal buildings. These were two institutions that the Secessionists 
were fighting to be taken seriously by. By being right in the middle of all of it, they were taking a stand to show they were here to stay.
