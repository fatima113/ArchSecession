[Youtube video: Architectural masterpieces of Vienna and Otto Wagner][1] 

The inclusion of this building in a video about Otto Wagner and Viennese architecture is very significant. Olbrich drew heavily from 
what he learned as a student of Wagner, and this is really evident within this video. 
First of all, considering how young and inexperienced Olbrich was when designing this building, it is no wonder he relied so much on his
mentor's teachings.
Secondly, looking at Wagner's work, it is impossible to not see the similarities with Olbrich's Secession building. A few of these 
similarities worth mentioning:
* Large dome front and center
* Gold details throughout the facade
* Geometric proportions and shapes
